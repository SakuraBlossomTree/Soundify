Great to hear that you can play music with the Piped API! Here are some suggestions on what you can work on next:

3. Audio Controls: Add more audio control features like repeat, shuffle, and seeking within tracks. These enhance the user's music playback experience.

4. Offline Mode: Implement a feature that allows users to download tracks for offline listening. This is particularly useful for mobile apps.

6. Search and Discovery: Enhance the search functionality by providing recommendations, trending tracks, and similar artist suggestions.

7. Integrate API*: If you haven't already, consider integrating other APIs like Last.fm for artist information, Spotify API for playlists, or Lyrics API for displaying song lyrics.

8. Enhance UI/UX: Improve the user interface and user experience of your app. Make sure it's easy to navigate and visually appealing.

9. Testing: Extensively test your app to ensure that it works smoothly on various devices and under different network conditions.

10. Documentation: If you're planning to publish this app or share it with others, consider creating documentation for its features and functionalities.

11. Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to gracefully manage issues like network problems, API failures, and track loading errors.

12. Performance Optimization: Optimize your app for better performance, especially if you're dealing with large audio files.

Remember to prioritize features based on the needs of your users and your project's goals. Additionally, continuously gather feedback from users to make informed decisions on what to work on next.
