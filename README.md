## Description

Soundify is a (Not Yet) Open Source Spotify Client, it uses Piped and JioSaavan API to get audio sources

I started this project because of latest Spotify Premium changes which take away most of the essential features  

I am trying to learn about React Native as much as possible while making the app

## Installation

#### Simple Installation Guide

1. Go to the Releases Tab

2. Download the desired version

3. Install the APK

## Usage

#### How to use the app

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

1. Go to the Settings Tab and choose a Piped Instance or JioSaavan and press on Set Instance , if you want to get started I recommand using JioSaavan because Piped servers are unstable

2. Go to Search and Type your Song, if it doesn't come up try this format [song-name] [artist-name] and then hit the play icon.

3. This will then navigate you to the Music Player where you can press the Plus Icon and then Play the Song.
